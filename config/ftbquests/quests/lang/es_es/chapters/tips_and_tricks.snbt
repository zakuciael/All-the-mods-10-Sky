They will use FE to fly and yes you will drop if you run out of Energy. \\nTo fly you'll need to turn on your Engine (V), then when you hold Space you'll fly up and drop when you let go. \\n\\nFor those who don't enjoy dropping, then you can turn on Hover (Unbinded), when set on you will Fly at the same altitude; being able to go higher with (Space) and lower with (Shift). \\n\\nTo adjust how fast you fly, change your Throttle.
